Real-Time Emotion-Based Music Recommender
Project Description: A computer vision application that detects user emotions via webcam in real-time and recommends Spotify playlists matching their mood, creating a personalized, adaptive music experience.​

Real-World Use Case:
Mental health and wellness apps are booming. This project addresses emotional well-being by creating ambient experiences tailored to users' current state. It has applications in therapy sessions, meditation apps, fitness programs, and productivity tools. Imagine a study app that detects when you're stressed and plays calming music automatically.​

Suggested Tech Stack:

Backend: Python with FastAPI (handles real-time video streaming better)​

Computer Vision: OpenCV + pre-trained deep learning models (FER2013 emotion detection)​

ML Models: TensorFlow or PyTorch with pre-trained CNNs for emotion classification​

API Integration: Spotify Web API for playlist recommendations​

Frontend: Gradio (instant webcam integration) or custom HTML/JavaScript​

Deployment: Docker container on AWS EC2 (free tier) or Heroku​

AI Features and Implementation:

Emotion Detection: Uses OpenCV to capture webcam frames and a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify emotions into categories (happy, sad, angry, neutral, surprised) with 70%+ accuracy​​

Real-Time Processing: Processes video frames at 10-15 FPS, implementing frame skipping to reduce computational load while maintaining responsiveness​

Mood-to-Music Mapping: Creates a mapping algorithm that translates detected emotions to Spotify playlist attributes (valence, energy, tempo). For example, "sad" → low valence playlists, "energetic" → high tempo tracks​

Adaptive Learning: Stores user feedback (thumbs up/down on recommendations) and fine-tunes emotion-to-genre mappings using a simple reinforcement learning approach​

Advanced Feature to Stand Out:
Implement emotion trend tracking with visualization using matplotlib/Plotly. Show users their emotional patterns over time (e.g., "You were most stressed on Tuesday afternoons") and suggest lifestyle insights. Add a "focus mode" that detects when users are distracted (looking away from screen) and pauses music until they return.​

How to Pitch on Resume/Interview:
"Developed a real-time emotion recognition system using OpenCV and TensorFlow, processing webcam input at 12 FPS to classify user emotions with 73% accuracy. Integrated Spotify Web API to dynamically recommend mood-aligned playlists, implementing an adaptive algorithm that improves recommendations based on user feedback. Deployed via Docker on AWS EC2 with FastAPI backend, showcasing proficiency in computer vision, API integration, and cloud deployment."

Why Recruiters Love This: Combines multiple in-demand skills (computer vision, real-time processing, API integration, ML model deployment), has a creative "wow factor" during demos, and shows you can work with diverse data types (images, audio metadata). The mental health angle demonstrates awareness of social impact.
